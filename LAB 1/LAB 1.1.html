	<h3>Pets and the Pandemic</h3>

	<p>A report from Animal Medicines Australia (AMA) has found that many Australians took the opportunity 
	   to introduce a pet into their household during the pandemic. Their survey indicated that there was a
	   significant increase in the percent of households taking in a new dog, fish or bird. 
	   Their research also indicated that pets had a number of positive influences on their lives such as:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>companionship</li>
		<li>better mental health</li>
		<li>joy and happiness.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> With the increase in pet ownership the AMA are encouraging policy makers 
		to consider the needs of companion animals and their owners when 
		considering rental, strata and body corporate regulations are well as 
		accepting animals in public places and transport.</p>
